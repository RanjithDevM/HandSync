# HandSync
HandSync is a real-time gesture-controlled system that allows users to control their computer using hand movements captured through a webcam. The project replaces traditional mouse and keyboard interactions with intuitive hand gestures for everyday system operations.


🚀 Features

Smooth mouse movement using finger tracking

Gesture-based left click, right click, double click, and scrolling

Volume control, mute/unmute, and media play/pause

Screenshot capture using hand gestures

Window switching (Alt+Tab) and application launching

Real-time object detection during live camera feed

Two-hand support with gesture stability and smoothing

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python

OpenCV

MediaPipe – hand landmark tracking

YOLO – real-time object detection

PyAutoGUI – system-level automation

🎯 Purpose

HandSync focuses on building a practical, touchless interaction system using computer vision techniques. The project emphasizes real-time performance, gesture accuracy, and smooth user experience.
